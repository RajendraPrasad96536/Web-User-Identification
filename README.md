# Web User Identification


### Description: Web-user identification is one of the important problems in behavioural psy-chology. Here we try to identify a user on the Internet by tracking his/her sequence ofvisited Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session (a sequence of ten webpages visited consecutively by the same person) along with the start time of visitfor a webpage and predict whether it belongs to Alice (1) or somebody else (0). 

###### Build a classifier which can identify whether the user is Alice using 10-fold cross-validation. Report the cross-validation based error for your final classifier. Do mention what all classifiers you tried and justify your choice.

###### Prepareing a file which gives prediction for the test data.

###### Which variables turn out to be the most useful?
